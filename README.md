# Robust Hyperparameter Tuning for a Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project demonstrates a rigorous approach to hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using cross-validation. A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier is trained to predict bank customer churn, with a focus on finding the optimal number of neighbors (`k`) to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to showcase the process of using **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to select the optimal hyperparameter for a classifier. This method provides a robust estimate of the model's performance and helps prevent overfitting, which is a critical skill in professional machine learning workflows.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

  * **Supervised Learning:** Binary Classification
  * **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** A non-parametric classification algorithm.
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematically searching for the best model configuration.
  * **Cross-Validation:** Using **Stratified K-Fold** to get a reliable estimate of model performance.
  * **Data Preprocessing:** Using `StandardScaler` for feature scaling and `One-Hot Encoding` for categorical variables.
  * **Scikit-learn Pipelines:** Chaining preprocessing and modeling steps to prevent data leakage.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Bank Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle. It contains 10,000 records of bank customers with attributes like credit score, age, and tenure.

## Setup and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/mldm-robust-churn-model.git
    cd mldm-robust-churn-model
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the virtual environment using `uv`:**

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    uv pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyterlab
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Lab and open the notebook:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m jupyter lab
    ```

    Open the `hyperparameter-tuning-using-CV.ipynb` notebook to see the analysis.

## Results and Conclusion

A loop was performed for `k` values from 1 to 30. For each `k`, a 10-fold stratified cross-validation was executed, and the mean accuracy was recorded. The results were plotted to find the optimal value.

The analysis concluded that:

  * The optimal number of neighbors is **k = 15**.
  * The robust, cross-validated accuracy for this model is **0.8351**.

This process ensures that the selected model and its performance metric are reliable and not just a result of a lucky train/test split.
